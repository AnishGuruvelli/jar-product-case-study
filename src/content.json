      "problem": "Users often treat JAR as a passive tool‚Äîsetting up auto-saves and rarely returning‚Äîwhile the platform lacks features to define and track multiple, diversified goals simultaneously. This limits habit reinforcement, personalization, and overall app stickiness.",
      "friction": "I set up my savings once and forget about it. I also want to save separately for a phone, bike, and smartwatch‚Äîwith different amounts and timelines. JAR doesn't help me track or stay accountable for each.",

    {
      "title": "Limited Diversification Options Beyond Digital Gold",
      "problem": "While JAR is excellent for gold savings, users who have established a savings habit often seek to diversify their investments into other asset classes to optimize returns or align with different risk appetites and long-term financial goals. JAR's current gold-centric focus limits its potential as a holistic financial companion.",
      "friction": "I've invested in gold, and now I want to diversify. JAR's goal is to be a holistic financial companion, not just gold-oriented, so where else can I invest?",

        "whatItDoes": "Allows users to create multiple 'Goal Jars' (e.g., Bike, Phone, Travel) with separate targets, contribution plans, and timelines. Adds gamified streaks and rewards for consistent saving across each goal. Users earn coins or gold credits for saving regularly, which boosts habit formation and encourages higher engagement.",
        "whyItHelps": "Combines personalized motivation and fun to make saving feel more tangible and rewarding. Drives app stickiness, increases daily/weekly interactions, and helps users stay accountable to diverse financial goals.",
        "example": "You've saved for 12 days straight in your 'Phone Jar'‚Äîkeep the streak alive! You're 80% to your goal. Earn 5 coins today by increasing your savings by ‚Çπ20.",

        "whyItHelps": "Unlocks more return potential and reduces dependency on gold. Makes JAR a more complete financial partner and grows AUM through smarter investment matching.",
        "example": "You're saving ‚Çπ100/day for your bike. Based on your timeline, we suggest adding a micro-SIP too in Fund A (low risk, 12% expected returns, 1% greated than Gold) to reach your goal 4 months earlier.",
